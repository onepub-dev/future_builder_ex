# 1.1.1
- BUG: fixed call to Logger().d as we were passing the stacktrace as the wrong argument.
- removed the linux and web directories as we have no platform specific code.
- remove the android and ios directories as we don't have any platform specific code so they are not needed. Exported StrackTraceImpl as its required by the api.
